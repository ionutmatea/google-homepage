My project for the odin project lesson: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav#try-these-before-starting

The easy one, just the google homepage

The page looks somewhat ok...
I am annoyed by the searchbar border. If i add border-radius is appears to be two-toned, like a shadow effect.
The css is somewhat messy..
